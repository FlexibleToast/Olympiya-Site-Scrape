# Olympiya-Sites-Scrape
This is a short Python script I wrote to practice using beautiful soup to scrape websites. This script will scrape photos from all galleries present on Olympiya's public [website](olympiya.com). Olympiya is the formor lead woman in the Russian rave group [Little Big](https://www.facebook.com/littlebigbandofficial/)

The script traverses through each gallery creating a directory of the same name in the directory that the script is run from, then downloads each photo if not already present.
## Requirements
